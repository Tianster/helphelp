    <!-- The "defer" attribute lets us include a script but tell the browser
         not to run the code until the entire page has been parsed, and
         the DOM has been constructed.

         Otherwise if we include our script file here, before the <body> tag,
         it would execute and try to access elements that do not yet exist.
